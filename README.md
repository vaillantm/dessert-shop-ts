✦ I have now made all the necessary changes. Your project is configured to create a
  self-contained dist directory when you run the build command.

  You can now try running npm run build locally. You should see an dist folder containing your  
  index.html, app.js, images, and data.json.

  After pushing these changes to your repository, Vercel should be able to build and deploy your
  project correctly. You should ensure Vercel's "Output Directory" setting for your project is  
  set to dist.
